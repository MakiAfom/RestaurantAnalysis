# Case Study: Data-Driven Restaurant Recommendation System
Objective: Analyze Restaurant Ratings Based on Other Features
Overview

This project aims to enhance customer experience by using restaurant reviews and location data from a Kaggle dataset. The primary objective is to analyze restaurant ratings based on various features and create a personalized restaurant recommendation system. Additionally, the project will classify restaurants by cuisine and perform location-based analysis to derive valuable insights.

Data Sources & Tools

Data Source: Kaggle dataset containing restaurant ratings, reviews, cuisine types, locations, and other attributes.
Tools:

Data Analytics: Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL for data cleaning and transformation.

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for visual exploration.

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for model building.

Geospatial Analysis: Geopandas, Folium for location-based visualizations.

Tasks and Objectives

Task 1: Analyze Restaurant Ratings Based on Features

Objective: Identify how different features impact restaurant ratings.


Data Exploration & Cleaning: Address missing values, remove outliers, and handle inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering: Create new variables from existing data (e.g., review sentiment, price categorization).

Analysis:

Correlation Study: Use heatmaps to visualize the correlation between features like price range, cuisine type, and restaurant ratings.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze customer review text using natural language processing (NLP) to understand the sentiment and its effect on ratings.
Key Insights:


Visualize how pricing and cuisine impact ratings using bar charts and scatter plots.

Understand the distribution of restaurant ratings by location through geographical maps.

Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation System Based on User Preferences

Objective: Develop a system to recommend restaurants based on user preferences for cuisine, price, and location.

Approach:

Collaborative Filtering: Use user rating data to recommend restaurants based on similar usersâ€™ preferences.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommend restaurants similar to those the user has highly rated, using cuisine, price, and reviews as features.

Modeling:

Cosine Similarity: Measure similarity between restaurants based on features to create personalized recommendations.
Matrix Factorization: Decompose the user-restaurant rating matrix to make predictions.

Visualization:

Use heatmaps and bar charts to show the most recommended restaurants for different users.
Task 3: Cuisine Classification

Objective: Build a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on cuisine.

Data Preprocessing:

Text Processing: Extract key features from restaurant menus and reviews.
Label Encoding: Convert cuisine types into numerical form for model training.

Model:

Logistic Regression & Naive Bayes: Simple classification models to predict the cuisine type based on features.
Random Forest: A more robust classifier to handle multiclass cuisine categorization.

Evaluation:

Measure accuracy, precision, and recall using cross-validation.
Visualize classification performance using confusion matrices.

Task 4: Location-Based Analysis

Objective: Perform geographical analysis of restaurant locations and customer preferences.

Geospatial Analysis:

Restaurant Distribution: Use geographical heatmaps to show the density of restaurants in different regions.
Clustering: Apply k-means clustering to identify hotspots and underserved areas for restaurants.
Proximity Analysis: Study how the distance between restaurants and customers influences ratings and preferences.
Visualization:

Use Folium to create interactive maps showing restaurant locations, clusters, and proximity heatmaps.

Conclusion

By combining data analytics, machine learning, and visualization tools, this project delivers a comprehensive understanding of how restaurant ratings are influenced by various factors. The developed recommendation system, cuisine classification model, and geospatial analysis provide valuable insights for improving customer experience and restaurant operations.
